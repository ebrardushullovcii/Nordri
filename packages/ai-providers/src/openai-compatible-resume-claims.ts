    'verdict "supported": the evidence states it, in these or other words. A skill named in a skills section is supported when the evidence shows the candidate using it. Summaries that combine supported facts are supported.',
    'verdict "stretch": a small, plausible step beyond the evidence that the candidate could back in an interview, such as a technology the job asks for that fits work they describe, or years of experience rounded up by at most one. The candidate confirms each stretch before the resume is used.',
    'verdict "unsupported": the evidence does not support it: an invented number, result, employer, title, date, degree, certification or achievement, a tool or duty with no basis in the evidence, or a duty from the job posting written as the candidate\'s own experience.',
    "Check every factual part of each line, including summaries and skills. A line mixing supported and unsupported facts is never supported as a whole. Name each unbacked part in the reason and remove it in the fix. Do not transfer a tool, location, work mode, duty or result from one role to another without evidence for that role.",
    "A related skill does not prove a different skill, and a general duty does not prove a particular implementation detail. A listing requirement is context, not proof: in aggressive mode a plausible related skill can at most be a stretch requiring confirmation. An invented implementation detail or work mode is unsupported even in aggressive mode.",
    "Keep every stated skill level and limit, including basic or still learning, seasonal or partial dates, credential years and renewal dates, and quantified results with their exact numbers. Removing a limit can strengthen a claim and must be fixed. Skills fixes preserve the full supported skill name and proficiency, with no word limit.",
    "Judge the meaning, not the wording: rewording a supported fact is supported. Do not call a line unsupported only because its exact words are missing.",
    "Read resumeLines for the whole visible draft, including lines outside this batch. Each distinct achievement and qualification should appear once. When a requested line repeats an earlier fact or repeats the same software or duty within a sentence, give it a style note and a concise fix that preserves distinct facts; use an empty fix when an earlier line already states the whole fact. A degree in Education does not also need its own repeated description. A summary should explain supported results and experience clearly, without repeated tools or generic listing phrases about communication and willingness to learn.",
    "style: a short note addressed to the candidate when the line is not finished resume writing: a bare list of keywords outside a skills section, a fragment, generic filler, or first-person prose; null otherwise. A skills section is a list by design.",
    'For every stretch or unsupported line, and every line with a style note, also give "fix": the line rewritten so it claims only what the evidence backs, keeping the line\'s language, the section\'s style and as much of the line as the evidence supports (drop the unbacked tool, number or duty; keep the rest), or "" when nothing in it can be kept, such as a skill the candidate does not have. In a skills list the fix is one complete skill, including its stated proficiency, that the evidence shows, or "". Outside a skills section a fix is finished resume writing, a complete statement and never a bare list of skills; when only such a list would remain, return "" (the skills section already holds the skills). Never add a fact to the fix that the evidence does not state. Omit "fix" for supported lines without a style note.',
