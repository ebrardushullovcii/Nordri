/**
 * Bump both values together whenever scoring OUTPUT changes, not only when the
 * scorer's shape changes. The fingerprints below are computed over the profile
 * and preferences alone, so an assessment persisted by an earlier build hashes
 * identically under a later one and is reused verbatim: a returning workspace
 * would keep stale scores forever. The revision inside each fingerprint prefix
 * is the only thing that forces a recalculation.
 *
 * Revision 8 (scorer version 9): a saved location that is only an absence
 * placeholder ("Location not stated", "N/A") stopped counting as a geographic
 * constraint, so `hasLocationPreferences`, the preference facet's existence and
 * evidence line, the location requirement, and `getBroadLocationCompatibility`
 * all changed answers for those profiles. Measured against the previous build,
 * an identical placeholder-only input scored 68 before and 71 after.
 *
 * Revision 9 (scorer version 10): the assessment now records `locationReach`,
 * the listing's standing against the saved areas, so Best-match ordering can
 * keep an on-site role outside every saved area below in-area and remote roles
 * of the same title fit. Scores are unchanged; assessments written before this
 * revision carry no reach and must be recalculated to gain one.
 *
 * Revision 10 (scorer version 11): occupation, career-stage, explicit hours,
 * and travel-evidence scoring changed. Returning workspaces must not reuse a
 * version-10 score just because the profile and posting text are unchanged.
 *
 * Revision 11 (scorer version 12): US country aliases now compare as the same
 * place, and explicit occupations take precedence over a shared head noun.
 * Retire cached location conflicts and wrong-family recommendations.
 *
 * Revision 12 (scorer version 13): explicit summary language evidence and
 * customer implementation requirements now participate in assessment.
