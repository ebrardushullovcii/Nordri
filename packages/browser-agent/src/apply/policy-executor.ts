/**
 * The safety layer between the model and the page.
 *
 * It is deliberately thin. The model decides where to go, what to press, and
 * how to get through a site; none of that is second-guessed here. What this
 * layer does is the short list of things that must not depend on a model
 * being right:
 *
 * - an answer about the person comes from the person's own facts, not from
 *   the model's memory of them
 * - a declaration the person has to make themselves is only made when they
 *   approved that exact kind in advance
 * - a write proposed against a page that has since moved on is retried
 *   against the page as it is now, rather than landing in the wrong field
 * - sending an application goes through its own preflight and authority
 * - the origin allowlist is enforced only at the irreversible send preflight;
 *   ordinary navigation is governed by the reviewed-move path below
 *
 * Everything else — cookie banners, chat widgets, redirects, listings that
 * link to a different company's site, buttons made out of divs — is the
 * model's to work out, the way a person would.
